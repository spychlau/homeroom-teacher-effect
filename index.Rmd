Researchers make different decisions during data management process to deal with many issues such as missing data and outliers, trade-off between type I and II errors, coding and weighting, etc., before getting hands on sample data and conducting analysis. Why and how these decisions have been made remain largely invisible in reports and articles. During my first data management experience as a researcher - trimming my sample data from the first nationally representative longitudinal data in Chinese secondary education, the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS, website: https://ceps.ruc.edu.cn/index.php?r=index/index&hl=en) , I feel it necessary to openly discuss the issues and decisions involved in each step of my data management process in hopes of collecting feedback and insights from my colleagues and audience.

***Purpose of this Site***

This site serves as a *dairy* of visualization, communication, and discussion of the data management desicions I have made to get the sample that can meet my research goal and better answer my research questions. 

***Research Questions***

1. Whether homeroom teachers having positive relationship with students improve students’ learning manifested by students’ larger score gain on the subjects they teach over others?

2. Whether homeroom teachers having positive relationship with students improve students' overall academic, behavioral, and psychological outcomes over time?


***Literature Review***
